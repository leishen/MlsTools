A collection of scripts I use for reviewing houses and quickly
trying to determine status changes.  

Requirements:
    BeautifulSoup

remax.py <mlsnum> 
    Lookup a house on RE/MAX and grab relevant financial information

    Read a spreadsheet with a minimum set of headers that include:
    * MLS
    * Address
    * Asking Price
    * Yearly Taxes
    * HOA (Monthly)
    
    Look up each house on RE/MAX and ascertain whether the house has
    changed in one of the following ways:
    * Price changed
    * Status changed
    * House no longer available
